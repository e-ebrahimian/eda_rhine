Q1.
Median and 50% quantile are same.

Q2. 
as it is mentioned and can be seen, the runoff value data is not symetric and it is skewed to left. 
In fact, the distribution is not normal. 
it is good to mention that outliers simply shift mean, but median is more resistant statistic.


Q3.
I did not find something strange. 
ther are some points that I thaught about:
 -  their elevations is very low - less than 10m - . which is not very strange because they are nearer to sea.
 -  the distance of LOBI station from the river itself.
 -  the REES is the first one in order in data, but  LOBI is the 11th. so I don't know what this order means.

Q4.
