## Question 1 ##

rc = 185000  ### Rhine Catchment Area is 185000 Km2 based on web search ####

rc



## Question 2 ##

rl = 1233000  ### Rhine Length (m) ###

rwa = 185000 *1000000 /1233000  ####Rhine average width ####

rwa


perc =  0.05 * 24  #### percipitation in 24 hours (m3) ###

perc

rf = (0.05 / 3600) * rwa   #### increase in runoff (m3/sec) ####

rf      ## which is about  2.083897  m3/sec  ##


## Question 3 ##

## average Rhine discharge  (ard)= 2900  m3/s  ##
##  the time that a droplet takes to sail all river length  (ti)=  catchment River Volume / average discharge ##
ti = (rc * rl) / ard  
ti    ## it is 78656897 s , which is almost  910 days



## Question 4  a ##


 Lower summer discharge due to the reduced winter snow storage 

 and Increase in evapotranspiration




## Question 4  b  ##
#
# Differences CAN be due to these factors:

   1) different physical characteristics of the studied areas

   2) different spatial and temporal scales used in the modelling

   3) different representations of several hydrological processes(like evapotranspiration,snow melt)





## Question 4 c  ##

 The reason here is somehow similar to the reason of the Columbus example

 which is mainly an econimic reason.

 In brief, they mentioned Socio-economic sectors, tourism, flood risks (which

 directly affects on agriculture and industry and ...). Therefore, to have strategic plans

 in management, and to face the impacts of climate changes in wise way (that they call 

 no-regret and flexible), it is good to have these kind of research data




## Question 4 d  ##


 Yes. for example (in Rhine Region):

##  Question 4 e  ##
Yes. According to the following source (which is Netherlands Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment) in the autumn of 2018, the Rhine discharge (near the village Lobith) was the 4th lowest on record.
It can be seen from the diagram at the bottom of the following webpage,  that in December 2011 there is a sharpe rise in discharge which is somehow unique during last 70 years (after 1947).
